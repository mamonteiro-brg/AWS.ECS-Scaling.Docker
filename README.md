About the course

Learn to deploy Docker with AWS EC2 Container Service (ECS)

Now, I am able to scale web applications with Docker
I gained heaps of practical knowledge about working with Amazon Web Services (AWS)

One awesome thing about using AWS is that a ton of companies are hiring people who have experience with it. All of the knowledge you gain from this course can be used to apply for DevOps or cloud computing positions.

The main AWS component that you'll learn about in this course is Amazon ECS, which is the Amazon EC2 Container Service. It's Amazon's take on how to manage a cluster of Docker containers.

The first section of this course will concentrate on getting familiar with AWS and then performing a deep dive on Amazon ECS where you'll learn everything there is to know about it. You'll also get familiar with Amazon ECR which is Amazon's private Docker registry.

During this deep dive there will be plenty of guided labs to get your hands dirty.

The second section of this course will be all about Dockerizing a multi-service Ruby on Rails application, as well as profiling that application with Docker and other open source tools.

If you're not a developer or have no intentions of using Ruby on Rails that's fine because you can skip the development section. The only thing you'll have to do is build the Docker image, which will be as simple as running a few commands.

The third section of this course will be taking the knowledge learned from previous sections and deploying the application to production on AWS.

You'll learn how to calculate costs for a real life project hosted on AWS and load balance the web application so you can scale out to as many hosts as you need.

Along the way you'll learn about many other AWS resources and also learn how to hook up a domain name to a load balancer and secure it with a free SSL certificate.

This course was very hands on, with just enough theory to understand the main goal -- which is to get you comfortable scaling your web apps with Docker on AWS.
